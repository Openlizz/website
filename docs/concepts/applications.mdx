# Lizz-compatible application

A Lizz-compatible application is an application that can be added with the `lizz add` command.
There are some concepts and requirements which are explained on this page.

## Tenant repository

As explained [previously](./multi_tenancy), Lizz follows the multi-tenant structure and each application is associated with a tenant.
Concretely, this means that an application is a Git repository.
The repository contains the application manifests which can be any Kubernetes resources (Deployment, Pod, HelmRelease, etc...).
It only needs to contain a [Kustomization resource](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/) that points to the other resources.
A good example of a tenant repository structure can be found [here](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-multi-tenancy#repository-structure).

For example, the repository structure of the [Nextcloud application](https://github.com/Openlizz/application-nextcloud) is the following:

```
├── base
│   ├── certificate.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   ├── release.yaml
│   ├── secret.yaml
│   └── source.yaml
├── default
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── lizz.yaml
```

The `base` folder contains the manifests of the application and a Kustomization resource.
The `default` folder contains the default Kustomization resource that simply points to the `base` folder without any kustomization of the manifests.
It is possible to add other folders with other Kustomization resources depending on the use cases, for example, a specific configuration of the application for a specific cloud provider.
The `lizz.yaml` file is the Lizz configuration file which is explained later on this page.

## Application template

A Lizz-compatible application is automatically configured according to the cluster in which it will be added.
This mechanism works similarly to [Helm chart template mechanism](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/).

<TemplatingSvg className="illuSvg" />

The `lizz.yaml` file defines values that can be used in the manifests of the application.
Lizz uses the [standard template library of Go](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) enhanced with [template functions from the Sprig library](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/).

### Values

There are multiple types of values, each one serves a different purpose.

```go
type Values struct {
	ApplicationDependencies []ApplicationDependency `json:"applicationDependencies,omitempty"`
	UserValues              []UserValue             `json:"userValues,omitempty"`
	ClusterValues           []ClusterValue          `json:"clusterValues,omitempty"`
	ApplicationValues       []ApplicationValue      `json:"applicationValues,omitempty"`
	ApplicationSecrets      []ApplicationSecret     `json:"applicationSecrets,omitempty"`
	Passwords               []Password              `json:"passwords,omitempty"`
}
```

The detail of the available values to an application can be found in the [Values page](./values).

### Templates

The values are passed to the templates as a map (`map[string]interface{}`) and can be accessed in the template as follows:

```
{{ index . "<Name of the value>" }}
```

It is possible to create complex flow as described in the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/control_structures/).
Here is an example with the beginning of the `release.yaml` file of the [Homer application](https://github.com/Openlizz/application-homer):

```yaml title="base/release.yaml"
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: homer
  namespace: {{ index . "namespace" }}
spec:
  serviceAccountName: {{ index . "serviceAccountName" }}
  releaseName: homer
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: homer
      version: "8.0.2"
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: k8s-at-home
  interval: 30m
  install:
    remediation:
      retries: 3
  test:
    enable: false
  values:
    ingress:
      main:
        {{- if and (index . "isNginxInstalled") (index . "isDomainInstalled") }}
        enabled: true
        annotations:
          kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        hosts:
          - host: homer.{{ index . "domain"}}
            paths:
              - path: "/"
                pathType: Prefix
        {{- else }}
        enable: false
        {{- end }}
        {{- if and (index . "isNginxInstalled") (index . "isDomainInstalled") (index . "isCertManagerInstalled") }}
        tls:
          - secretName: homer-cert
            hosts:
              - homer.{{ index . "domain"}}
        {{- end }}
[...]
```
