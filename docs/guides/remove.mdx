# Remove an application from the cluster

This guide show how to remove an application from you cluster.

## Requirements

To remove an application, you first need to have [added an application to your cluster](./add).

## Remove an application

You can remove an application with the following command:

<Tabs groupId="git-providers">
<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">

```
lizz remove github --owner=$GITHUB_USER  --fleet=fleet --name=<name of the application> --personal
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">

```
lizz remove gitlab --owner=$GITLAB_USER  --fleet=fleet --name=<name of the application> --personal
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output is similar to:

```
Remove application...
 âœ“ Clone the cluster repository
 âœ“ Open and read the cluster configuration file
 âœ“ Remove the application from the cluster
 âœ“ Commit and push to the cluster repository
```

This command removes the application from the fleet repository but **do not delete the application repository**.

## Reconcile the fleet repository

As with the add command, with the remove command you need to reconcile the fleet repository to apply the changes directly:

```
flux reconcile source git flux-system
```

## Next

You can see how to [refresh an applications](./refresh) to refresh its configuration.
