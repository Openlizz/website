# Add the applications to your cluster

Now that the Ingress controller is correctly setup and you have a trusted certificate, you can continue with the add of the applications.

## Add the domain name application

The [domain name application](https://github.com/Openlizz/application-domain-name) is a very simple application.
Its only purpose is to contain the domain name value that can later be used by other applications.

The domain name value is a [user value](../../concepts/values#user-value) that has to be given to the application using the `--set-value` flag.
You can use the value you want, for example `home.cluster`.

```
lizz add github \
    --owner=$GITHUB_USER \
    --fleet=fleet \
    --origin-url=https://github.com/openlizz/application-domain-name \
    --path=./ \
    --destination=domain-name \
    --set-value value="home.cluster"
```

## Add the Photoprism, Nextloud, Vaultwarden, and Homer applications

The [Photoprism application](https://github.com/Openlizz/application-photoprism/) deploys [Photoprism](https://photoprism.app/), the [Nextloud application](https://github.com/Openlizz/application-nextcloud) deploys [Nextloud](https://nextcloud.com/), the [Vaultwarden application](https://github.com/Openlizz/application-vaultwarden) deploys [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) and the [Homer application](https://github.com/Openlizz/application-homer) deploys [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer).

Those four applications do not require a particular setup and can be added using the following commands:

```
lizz add github \
    --owner=$GITHUB_USER  \
    --fleet=fleet \
    --origin-url=https://github.com/openlizz/application-photoprism \
    --path=./default \
    --destination=photoprism

lizz add github \
    --owner=$GITHUB_USER  \
    --fleet=fleet \
    --origin-url=https://github.com/openlizz/application-nextcloud \
    --path=./default \
    --destination=nextcloud

lizz add github \
    --owner=$GITHUB_USER  \
    --fleet=fleet \
    --origin-url=https://github.com/openlizz/application-vaultwarden \
    --path=./default \
    --destination=vaultwarden

lizz add github \
    --owner=$GITHUB_USER  \
    --fleet=fleet \
    --origin-url=https://github.com/openlizz/application-homer \
    --path=./default \
    --destination=homer
```

:::info

The outputs of these commands contain passwords that you need to store in order to connect to the applications.

For example for Nextcloud:

```
 → adminPassword — Password for the admin account.
 → J8a375Qe9kYj
```

Note that you can also always find the passwords afterwards in the Kubernetes secrets.

:::

## Reconcile the fleet repository

With the add command, Lizz creates the application repositories and updates the fleet repository but Lizz does not interact with Kubernetes and therefore the applications are not deployed yet.

The deployement is made by Flux and you can force Flux to reconcile and deploy the applications now by running:

```
flux reconcile source git flux-system
```

This will start the deployment process.
You can watch the applications deployment with:

```
kubectl get helmreleases -A
```

After some time, the output should be similar to:

```
NAMESPACE         NAME           AGE    READY   STATUS
longhorn-system   longhorn       128m   True    Release reconciliation succeeded
cert-manager      cert-manager   112m   True    Release reconciliation succeeded
photoprism        photoprism     106m   True    Release reconciliation succeeded
homer             homer          105m   True    Release reconciliation succeeded
vaultwarden       vaultwarden    95m    True    Release reconciliation succeeded
nextcloud         nextcloud      89m    True    Release reconciliation succeeded
```

You can check that the pods are running with:

```
kubectl get pod --all-namespaces
```

After a couple of minutes, the output should be similar to:

```
NAMESPACE         NAME                                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS       AGE

```

## Automatic configuration

When added to the cluster, the applications have been configured in function of the cluster state.

For example, Nextcloud has been configured:

- with the domain name from the domain name application,
- with the ingress information from the Nginx, the cert-manager, and the cluster-issuer applications to work with HTTPS,

You have applications deployed in your cluster that are already configured and ready to use without effort.

## Access the applications

The Photoprism, Nextloud, Vaultwarden, and Homer applications are exposed to internet via ingresses.
You can get all the ingresses in your cluster by running:

```
kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces
```

The output should be:

```
NAMESPACE     NAME          CLASS    HOSTS                      ADDRESS         PORTS     AGE
photoprism    photoprism    <none>   photoprism.home.cluster    192.168.1.165   80, 443   108m
homer         homer         <none>   homer.home.cluster         192.168.1.165   80, 443   106m
vaultwarden   vaultwarden   <none>   vaultwarden.home.cluster   192.168.1.165   80, 443   97m
nextcloud     nextcloud     <none>   nextcloud.home.cluster     192.168.1.165   80, 443   91m
```

Under the `ADDRESS` column, you find the IP address of the NodePort.
You can add an entry in your `/etc/hosts` file to redirect all the `HOSTS` to the IP address.
For example, here you would have to add the following line in your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
192.168.1.165 homer.home.openlizz.com nextcloud.home.openlizz.com photoprism.home.openlizz.com vaultwarden.home.openlizz.com
```

To access the applications, the last thing is to obtain the port of the NodePort corresponding to HTTPS.
To do this run the following:

```
kubectl -n ingress-nginx get svc ingress-nginx-controller
```

The output should be similar to:

```
NAME                       TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
ingress-nginx-controller   NodePort   10.43.28.208   <none>        80:30967/TCP,443:31251/TCP   130m
```

Here the port corresponding to HTTPS is 31251.

You have now all the information to access your applications. For Nextcloud, the URL is in this example: [https://nextcloud.home.cluster:31251](https://nextcloud.home.cluster:31251).

## Use the applications

To use the applications, refeer to the usage section of the applications' repositories.

For Nextcloud, you can access Nextcloud via the previous URL and can connect using the admin password (from the add command output).

You can also look at the Homer homepage and should see something similar to:
